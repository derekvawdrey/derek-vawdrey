Derek Vawdrey: Welcome to my blog
---
As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I often find myself reflecting on the teachings of the gospel and the role they play in my life. In a world filled with turmoil and uncertainty, I am grateful to have a foundation of faith that provides me with guidance and comfort. This blog is my way of sharing my thoughts and insights with others who may be seeking a different perspective on life, spirituality, and the divine. Through my posts, I hope to provide a space for open and honest conversation about the complexities of faith and what it means to truly live a Christ-centered life.

I am not always a perfect individual, and my opinions my not always be correct. I simply wish to show my perspective on these important issues.
