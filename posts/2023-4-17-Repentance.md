title:  "Forgiveness"

Today as I was helping my brother check on his car I had an interesting experience that made me reflect on the revelations of God. 

I walked to his car and checked on it to make sure it was alright. Then I turned around and started walking back. As I was walking back I recieved a feeling I should go back and check on the car again. 

Knowing not to question God, I turned around, and as I turned around I noticed a broken pickle jar im a parking stall. Someone had dropped a pickle jar, and large pieces of glass were strewn throughout that single parking stall. Annoyed that someone would be irresonsible with glass in a parking lot, I kicked away the pieces of glass into a pile where it would not puncture a tire. 

I then promptly returned to my apartment not thinking much of it. 

Then as I was going to sleep I realized that God often gives me revelation like "go back and check on the car", or "check the door again". Not because I need to go back and check it, but because God needs me to do something else. God knows I will naturally pick up what I am supposed to do and doesn't prompt me further. God didn't tell me to go move those glass pieces, God knew that I would do it because that is the right thing to do. 

This is very personal for me, God knows how I will respond. God probably wouldn't say "go pickup that glass" if I didn't even notice the glass. Instead His promptings will put me in a situation so I will be able to see what needs to be done. 

God will do that. In 1st Nephi chapter 4:6 Nephi was guided by the spirit not knowing what to do. God gave Nephi what he needed to know, and let Nephi make the decision.
