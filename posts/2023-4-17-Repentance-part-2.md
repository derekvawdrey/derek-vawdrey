> Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. - Matthew 3:6

> I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. - Matthew 3:11

While John may baptize you with water for repentance, Jesus Christ can change you. This life is all about becoming like Him and becoming a better person. Eventually coming to the point where you will be sanctified and never wish to sin again. 

After Jesus had died he appeared to Saul and called him to repentance.

> “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” he replied. “Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.” - Act 9:5-6

God will come to us when we need him most, and we just need to not ignore Him. Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father love us and want the best for us.
