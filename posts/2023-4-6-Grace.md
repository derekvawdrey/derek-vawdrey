The "for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do"All that we can do means: Repent. Found in Alma 20 For in that sentence means "therefore"So basically it can be read as For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God. Therefore we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.Temple covenants are an act of grace. They will eventually be extended to everyone, either now, or after death. It will simply be a choice to accept "grace" or not.
